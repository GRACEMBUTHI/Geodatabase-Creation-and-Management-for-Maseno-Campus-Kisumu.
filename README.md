<h1>Maseno Campus Geodatabase Creaction and Management  </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved building a comprehensive geodatabase for Maseno Universityâ€™s campus area, integrating spatial and attribute data to support campus navigation, planning and infrastructure management. The project included data collection using GPS and digitization of features like roads, buildings, and utilities in Arcgis. The geodatabase was structured to allow easy querying, visualization, and analysis for improved campus resource management and planning decisions.
<br />


<h2>Project Objectives </h2>

- <b>To map out failities in Maseno Campus.</b> 
- <b>To build a geodatabase for these facilities.</b>
- <b>To host the database online in an accessible server.</b> 
  

<h2>Softwares Used </h2>

- <b>Arcgis</b> 
- <b>QGIS</b> 
- <b>Geoserver</b>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS </h2>
The geospatial analysis and mapping of the Maseno Hospital Area have revealed critical insights into the spatial arrangement, functionality, and condition of the campus infrastructure. The environment is generally well-maintained, with a good balance between developed spaces and green areas. However, certain environmental concerns;such as the proximity of the waste dumpsite to functional buildings;need to be addressed through improved planning and sustainable waste management.
Road infrastructure is fairly well-developed, with a clear hierarchy between main roads and pavements. Nevertheless, the condition and width of some pavements may hinder smooth pedestrian movement, calling for targeted upgrades to improve safety and mobility. The mapped transportation connectivity network provides a strong foundation for traffic flow, though congestion at major junctions remains an area for potential improvement.
Campus facilities;including hostels, lecture halls, clinics, and offices;are strategically located and accessible. However, population pressure on residential and learning spaces may require expansion or refurbishment in the near future. Drainage and power infrastructure are in place, though select areas would benefit from upgrades to enhance resilience and safety.
Overall, the developed geodatabase offers a powerful tool for campus management and planning. By enabling spatial querying, real-time updates, and online accessibility, it promotes data-driven decision-making among students, lecturers, administrators, and planners. The findings from this study set the stage for informed infrastructure development and environmental sustainability within Maseno Campus.
